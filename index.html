            Since 2011, the number of packages delivered nationally by USPS alone has increased by 88% [1]. We live in a time where we seek instant gratification. Companies like Amazon, Walmart, and many others have responded by offering two-day shipping and lately even two-hour shipping — ordering products and services has never been easier and more convenient.
