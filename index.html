                Since 2011, the number of packages delivered nationally by USPS alone has increased by 88% [1]. We live in a time where we seek instant gratification. Companies like Amazon, Walmart, and many others have responded by offering two-day shipping and lately even two-hour shipping — ordering products and services has never been easier and more convenient. However, these benefits come with a hidden cost — a cost to our environment, our planet, our home. In this article, we will delve deeper into how expedited shipping negatively impacts the environment, analyze different approaches to reduce our carbon footprint from deliveries, and consider the best possible solution.

                        Online shopping, also sometimes known as e-commerce, is not inherently bad. In fact, online shopping may actually be better for our environment than traditional shopping at a brick-and-mortar store. 
                        <br><br> Before I go into the ways in which online shopping is better for the environment with standard delivery, it’s important to note that these comparisons were based off <u>carbon footprints</u>. Carbon footprint is the estimation of the emission of greenhouse gases, which are the gases that contribute to climate change. Since carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) makes up 84% of total gases emission, the results from the research are expressed in kilograms of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent or kgCO<sub>2e</sub>. To give a better understanding of this measurement, 1 pound of gasoline produces 2.3 kilograms of CO<sub>2e</sub>, and this is roughly 3.3 miles of driving time for the average car [3].
                        <br><br>To calculate the carbon footprints of traditional shopping and online shopping, <u><strong>four</strong></u> main components were evaluated for the two shopping methods: the packaging, transportation, energy consumption, and information flow. <em>Packaging</em> is a big factor towards our carbon footprint for both the retail and online shopper. Retail stores often have secondary packaging like shrink wrap while online shopping always comes in a cardboard box with inner packaging like foam peanuts, bubble wrap, or air cushions. <em>Transportation</em> includes our individual vehicles and delivery vehicles like trucks and airplanes. For this study specifically, the calculations were based on US average fuel consumption of consumers and approximated travel distances of delivery vehicles. <em>Energy consumption</em> has to do with electricity and natural gas usage. There are a multitude of factors that play into this including the warehouses (where products are stored), the physical retail store, and computer electricity usage, to name a few significant ones. Lastly is <em>information flow</em>, which sounds complicated but simply has to do with the printed labels needed to track and identify products.

                        Great. Now we know that there is <u>ANOTHER</u> thing that we have to worry about negatively affecting our environment, like we didn’t have enough to worry about, right? Well believe it or not, for us a few, small lifestyle changes will heavily lower our carbon footprint. A lot of the changes that have to occur also depend on companies to change their infrastructure. There are a number of solutions, but I will only discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a few solutions that have been proposed or have been implemented already.

                <h3 class="content solution-header">The Shared-Use Vehicle Solution</h3>
                <div class="section-underline"></div>
                <div class="content">
                    One proposed solution is very simple. Proposed by Anne Goodchild, this solution suggests that people should always opt for online shopping over going to a physical store. This is because having a delivery service that optimizes a travel routing and delivery scheduling can end up reducing vehicle miles travelled by 85% to 95% which is much more effective that every individual household driving to their local store and back. It reduced the amount of carbon dioxide per customer on average between 20% and 75%.
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    Research has found that carbon emission reduction is greatest, roughly 80% to 90%, when the delivery service has a proximity-assigned set of customers — meaning a store has a set range of delivery. And even when delivery to customers was randomly assigned the reductions were still in between 17% to 75%, which is still a very significant amount [10]. 
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    This solution is very simple and effective which is great. Even though individual delivery vehicles emit more CO<sub>2</sub> than personal vehicles, as a whole, these delivery vehicles’ CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were still lower than personal vehicle use.
                    <br><br> However, this solution leaves quite a bit to be desired. This method would require these delivery services to choose when a package gets delivered meaning two-day shipping would likely dissolve. It would drastically change the way we have been online shopping probably resulting in many non-happy customers. In addition, without some enforced rule, companies would probably be unwilling to make this change as their competition/other companies may continue to offer expedited shipping.
                </div>


                <h3 class="content solution-header">Changing Consumer Behavior</h3>
                <div class="section-underline"></div>
                <div class="content">
                        I’m going to be honest; I have Amazon Prime and have never once even considered using anything but two-day shipping (granted I did not know about the cost of expedited shipping until after all my research). It wouldn’t really make sense for me to choose standard delivery over two-day shipping, after all it’s free. But what would happen if companies like Amazon were to provide a green option for shipping so that customers didn’t immediately just opt for expedited shipping without a second thought? 
                        <br><br> 	In the past few years, Amazon has added a no-rush shipping program. The program incentivizes customers to choose “No-Rush Shipping” delivery — an option that delivers packages to customers in 6 business days — that gives customers promotions or discounts for certain products [5].  It’s difficult to say exactly how effective this has been the past few years as Amazon has yet to release any data on it, but it is a great start in getting customers to consider a non-expedited delivery option.        
                        <br>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    The Proceedings of the National Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) conducted a study of 609 individuals to evaluate if Amazon could reduce their carbon footprint by simply being more transparent in their shipping options tab. The study had three groups: (1) the control group, in which the participants had the standard Amazon delivery options which included the No-Rush Shipping option with a $1 promotion incentive, (2) a group that saw “Make your shipping CARBON NEUTRAL when you choose FREE No-rush shipping” (3) a group that also got the $1 promotion incentive but if they chose No-Rush Shipping, had an option to donate a part of that to make their shipping “carbon neutral” —  offsetting carbon dioxide emissions by planting trees. The study revealed that the second option was just as if not more popular than the first option (the control group); people were more likely to choose No-Rush shipping when they were told their order would become carbon neutral [2]. <br><br>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    If companies were to be more transparent with their customers about how their choices could help the environment, a good amount of the customers will go for it. In fact, this method of transparency benefits all parties involved. The company will be able to save on fuel costs and gain consumer loyalty and trust due to their transparency while consumers receive discounts for their effort. More importantly, as a result, our world becomes a little less damaged as our carbon footprint decreases. The only problem with this solution is that the consumers have to make the smart choice to choose the No-Rush shipping option, and as consumers have to pay for subscriptions to receive expedited shipping many may be unwilling to opt for the no-rush option.

                <h3 class="content solution-header">Optimizing Traffic</h3>
                <div class="section-underline"></div>
                <div class="content">
                    So, what about a solution where we could potentially keep two-day shipping? Rather than changing customer behavior and shipping methods, one proposed solution is thinking about how to optimize traffic. 
                    <br><br>Recently there’s been an emergence of a connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology — it’s basically this new technology that researchers developed in hopes of improving mobility, safety, and sustainability at traffic signal intersections [12].
                    <br><br>Research has shown that transmitting the timing of traffic signals to vehicles could potentially allow vehicles to save 15 to 20% of their fuel, meaning less carbon emissions [4]. By transmitting the timing of traffic lights, trucks can better control their velocity, drive more smoothly, idle less in front of traffic lights. A simulation of CAV technology utilized in this context demonstrated that as more vehicles used this tech, energy consumption and carbon emissions would decrease. Vehicles were able to reduce energy consumption by more than 7% and emissions by 59%. 
                    <br>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                        Another method is called truck platooning. This method transmits and shares a trucks speed to the trucks behind it allowing trucks to drive simultaneously with the truck in front of it reducing drag or wind resistance. This has been shown to reduce fuel usage by 10 to 20%.
                        <br><br>	These solutions based on optimizing traffic offer a lot more advantages than the previous two solutions. In fact, both of these methods are more likely and feasible solutions for the future, mostly because they don’t drastically change the way things are now. Customers will be able to keep expedited shipping as delivery vehicles are able to better control their carbon emissions. The only disadvantage of this solution is that although it saves a lot on fuel, it is still not enough to completely eradicate our carbon footprint. In addition, the technology is relatively new so its real-life practicality and efficiency has yet to be tested.

                    <div class="content">
                            There is no perfect or ideal solution for lessening our carbon footprint when using online shopping and expedited deliveries. The “ideal” approach would be to implement a combination of some of the solutions that I have already mentioned — opting to online shop rather than driving back and forth, creating an incentive to change consumer behavior, and implementing more efficient vehicle transportation.
                            <br><br>Honestly, you might feel overwhelmed. You may ask, “What can I do? I’m just one person, one individual, I can’t do anything about it." But there are quite a few things that we as individuals can do that would significantly reduce our carbon footprint if we want to continue online shopping. The simplest and most obvious is to shop less! If you don’t need it, don’t buy it. If you really need to buy something, don’t choose expedited shopping just because it’s free. Choose standard shipping instead. Lastly, try to group all your items into one order. If there’s only one or two items in your cart, wait until it has at least four or five items before checking out.
                            <br><br>Online shopping is great. If I’m going to be honest, I’ll probably have to use expedited shipping sometime in the future, but the important thing is that we are aware of the environmental costs and try to opt for standard shipping over expedited shipping most of the time.  In the end, it really falls on all of us — consumers and companies alike — to be more conscientious about the environmental costs of our actions and think twice about the many things, like expedited shipping, that we take for granted.
